# Simple Shooter
Simple Shooter game written in Unreal Engine C++ for the Udemy "Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games" course 

Tools used: Unreal Engine 4.27.2, Visual Studio 2019 Community and Audacity (to convert the headshot sound from mp3 to wav)

Build and compile using Unreal Engine 4.27+.

With the keyboard, use WASD keys to move your character around and spacebar to jump. Move mouse to aim, left clicking to shoot and right clicking to zoom. Reload by pressing R key. Switch weapons by pressing 1 or 2 keys above WASD, or use the mouse scroll.

With the gamepad (tested with XBox controller), use left thumbstick to move your character around and use the face bottom button (A-Button in Xbox) to jump. Use the right thumbstick to aim, and then press the right shoulder (RS) button to shoot. To zoom, press the right thumbstick. To reload, press the face right button (B-Button in Xbox). To change weapons, press D-Pad left and right arrow buttons.

The game is won if you destroy all the enemy shooter characters, without your healthbar reaching zero. If your healthbar reaches zero, the game is lost. After each win/lose condition, the game restarts after 5 seconds.
